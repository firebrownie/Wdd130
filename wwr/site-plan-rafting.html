    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Us at "Healthy River" want nothing more than to bring awareness for a dying fad and trend that the world once loved.</p>
    <p>We believe that white water rafting has more purposes than just to provide a way for you to get in the water.</p>
    <p>Here at Healthy River, we provide not only an oppurtunity to be in water, but to connect with nature as well. Whether it's for loosing weight or taking advantage of our excellent romantic proposal pack, we got what you need right here.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>So, you made it this far. THANK YOU!! Okay, from the glory days of filling our water bottles with cool stickers, you might just be wondering why just rafting? Well, look no further friend, as of September 2023, we have a new addition to our program. The ~gift shop~. This shop not only has free water bottle fill ups with a complementary
    pack of "Liqud IV" we also provide anything from stickers, to scrunchies to pull your hair up. If you made it this far, please scroll down for a little surprise. ;\</p>

    <p>As you can see, our program here at "Healthy River" is top of the line as we only use organic and recycled materials for our boats. 50% of our proceedings go to a local woman's shelter located in Westview, New Jersey. Thank you for helping underprivileged women fulfill their dreams.</p>
    <p class="colored">Our products vary as do the people who buy from us vary. If you consider yourself overweight, you too can benefit from what our company has to offer. Like candy? Well, we got energy bites that taste like candy but with zero the calories.
     Anyone who is over 4 feet can benefit from our outdoor water activies. Anyone under 4 feet is welcome to try out our new VR set in the lobby of our main building.</p>
