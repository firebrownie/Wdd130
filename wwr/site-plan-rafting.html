    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Us at "The wonderful world of scrunchies" want nothing more than to bring awareness for a dying fad and trend that the world once loved.</p>
    <p>We believe that scrunchies have more purposes than just to provide a way for you to put your hair up.</p>
    <p>Here at The wonderful world of scrunchies, we make scrunchies to use in your daily life. Whether it's for hiding your money (see "Zipper scrunchies(in our shop)) or taking advantage of our vintage collection of scrunchie tops, we got what you need right here.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>So, you made it this far. THANK YOU!! Okay, from the glory days of filling our water bottles with endless stickers and saving the turtles, you might be wondering why just scrunchies? Well, look no further friend, as of September 2023, we have a new addition to our shop. The ~scrunchie straw~. This straw not only is reusable, but it also contracts (aka "scrunches up") to a satisfactory size. If you made it this far, please scroll down for a little gift from me to you ;\</p>

    <p>As you can see, our scrunchies are top of the line as we only use organic and recycled materials. 50% of our proceedings go to a local woman's shelter located in Westview, New Jersey. Thank you for helping underprivileged women fulfill their dreams.</p>
    <p class="colored">Our products vary as do the people who buy from us vary. If you are a man, you too can benefit from what our company has to offer. Like fishing? Well, we got fishing reels with durable scrunchie handles meant to last a lifetime. If you are a baby, have you ever heard of the scrunchie crib? Instead of packing every time you get out a giant pack and play, we sell a baby crib that scrunchies into a gallon ziplock bag.</p>
